# Face Recognition System for ID Verification with Aging and Low-Quality Images

## Introduction

Online identity verification using face recognition presents unique challenges when matching current user images to older ID photos (e.g. passport images up to 10 years old). Facial appearance changes over a decade due to aging, and user-submitted images may be dark or low-quality. Moreover, a system deployed in Cambodia must perform well on Cambodian facial characteristics, requiring consideration of demographic tuning. This report outlines recommendations for building a robust 1:1 face recognition system that addresses these challenges. We cover state-of-the-art face recognition models (ArcFace, CosFace, FaceNet, and recent transformer-based models) known for high accuracy and resilience to aging, strategies for adapting models to Cambodian faces and large age gaps, image pre-processing for low-light conditions, real-time deployment options (hardware and optimizations), and techniques to improve matching accuracy across 10-year age differences. The goal is a reliable, real-time face verification pipeline suitable for authenticating users against decade-old ID photos.

## State-of-the-Art Face Recognition Models

Choosing a strong pre-trained model is critical for accurate face matching over age gaps. Table 1 compares leading face recognition models on accuracy, robustness to aging, inference speed, and deployment ease. Classic CNN-based models like **FaceNet**, **ArcFace**, and **CosFace** have demonstrated near-human performance in face verification, while newer **transformer-based models** show promise for even greater robustness and efficiency.

* **FaceNet (2015)** – Google’s FaceNet introduced deep face embeddings using a triplet loss. It achieved \~99.63% verification accuracy on LFW, a landmark at the time. FaceNet uses an Inception-ResNet architecture and outputs 128-D or 512-D embeddings. It is robust but slightly less accurate than newer models on challenging benchmarks (e.g. lower verification rates on difficult cross-age test sets). Its smaller network can be advantageous for speed or lower-memory deployments. Open implementations are widely available (e.g. in TensorFlow), easing deployment.

* **ArcFace (2019)** – ArcFace is a state-of-the-art model using an additive angular margin loss to learn highly discriminative embeddings. With a ResNet100 backbone, ArcFace achieves around **99.8%** verification accuracy on LFW and has become a standard for high-accuracy face recognition. It outputs 512-D features and compares them via distances. ArcFace models (e.g. those from the InsightFace library) are known for robustness across various conditions; indeed, ArcFace maintains high accuracy across young and older age groups in evaluations. This makes it well-suited for recognizing faces with age differences. The model is larger than FaceNet but can still run in real-time on modern hardware. Pre-trained ArcFace models are publicly available, and the InsightFace framework provides optimized implementations for deployment.

* **CosFace (2018)** – CosFace uses a cosine margin loss for training embeddings, similar in spirit to ArcFace’s angular margin. It achieved about **99.73%** on LFW, on par with ArcFace. CosFace typically uses a ResNet backbone as well. Like ArcFace, it produces 512-D features and emphasizes inter-class separability with a margin. CosFace is highly accurate but, according to some reports, ArcFace’s loss can yield slightly better uniformity across age groups. Both ArcFace and CosFace are extremely robust, and many modern systems build on their insights. Open-source implementations (e.g. in InsightFace or facenet-pytorch) make them readily deployable.

* **Transformer-Based Models (2021–2024)** – Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently been applied to face recognition, often combined with ArcFace-like losses. Research shows ViT-based face models can **outperform CNN-based models in accuracy and robustness**, while also achieving competitive or better inference speed. For example, a Sparse ViT model (S-ViT) with ArcFace loss exceeded a ResNet-50 ArcFace’s accuracy by up to 3.27%. Transformers can inherently capture long-range facial feature relationships and have shown strength against occlusions and variations. In practice, transformer-based face models are emerging; frameworks like InsightFace have begun incorporating ViT backbones. While not yet as common in production as ResNet-based ArcFace, they are promising for a future-proof solution with high accuracy and fast inference (one study noted ViT models had **smaller memory footprints and inference speed rivaling the fastest CNNs**).

## Adapting Models to Cambodian Faces and Aging Data

Even the best pre-trained model may exhibit reduced accuracy if the population or image domain differs from its training data. Many face recognition models are trained on datasets dominated by Western and East Asian faces, which can introduce a **cross-race effect** – decreased accuracy when recognizing faces of an underrepresented ethnicity. To ensure excellent performance on Cambodian faces, the chosen model should be **fine-tuned or supplemented with data from Cambodian or broadly Southeast Asian populations**. This adaptation can involve several strategies:

* **Fine-Tuning on Regional Data:** If available, gather a dataset of Cambodian faces (passport photos, ID card images, selfie images from Cambodian users) and fine-tune the model on this data. Even a few thousand images of local faces can help the model adjust to prevalent facial features and skin tones. In absence of a dedicated Cambodian set, one can leverage Asian-focused face datasets. For example, the **Asian Face Dataset (AFD)** contains 360,000 images of 2019 Asian individuals, far more Asian representation than general datasets. There are also KYC (Know Your Customer) datasets tailored to ID verification: one such set provides document photos and selfies for 660 Asian individuals (South, East, and Middle Asia), which could include some Southeast Asian faces. Incorporating or fine-tuning on such data will reduce any ethnic bias and improve recognition accuracy on Cambodian users. The model will learn finer details (e.g. common facial shapes, eyelid structures, etc.) that might differ subtly from the faces it saw in initial training. Care should be taken to use a low learning rate and avoid overfitting when fine-tuning on a smaller set of faces.

* **Training with Age Diversity:** Ensuring the model is exposed to age variation is key for **age-invariant face recognition**. Standard face recognition training sets like MS1M, VGGFace2, or CASIA-WebFace do contain varied ages, but additional focus on aging can help. A strategy is to include **cross-age face pairs** during training – e.g. if possible, multiple images of the same individuals at different ages. Some public datasets specifically target aging, such as CACD (Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset) and AgeDB, which include the same persons at younger and older ages. Incorporating these or similar data helps the model learn age-resilient features. If real aging data is limited, **synthetic age augmentation** is an option: recent studies have used GAN-based face aging to generate older or younger versions of faces for training. Notably, using *synthetic aged images* can boost a model’s recognition rate on large age gaps – one experiment saw a **\~3.3% improvement in accuracy on faces with a 40-year age gap** by augmenting training with GAN-aged faces. For a 10-year gap scenario, synthetic aging data (e.g. creating a 10-years-older version of each face using an age progression model) could similarly make the embeddings more age-invariant.

* **Continuous Update with Local Data:** In deployment, the system can be improved by gradually collecting verification cases (with user consent) where the model was uncertain or made errors, then retraining or fine-tuning periodically. If the government or organization has an existing database of verified face images (e.g. from ID cards) across years, those could be used to further train the system to recognize faces aging over a decade. In practice, combining a large-scale general model (for broad robustness) with a lightweight fine-tuning on domain-specific data (for local tuning) yields the best of both worlds.

In summary, start with a top-tier model (ArcFace/CosFace or a ViT model) pre-trained on millions of faces, then **domain-adapt** it: fine-tune on a dataset emphasizing Cambodian and regional Asian faces and including age variation or augmentations. This will ensure the face embeddings remain discriminative even when comparing a current selfie to a 10-year-old passport photo of the same person.

## Image Pre-Processing for Low-Light Conditions

Quality of the input images significantly affects face recognition reliability. In online ID checks, users might upload selfies taken in suboptimal lighting (dim rooms, harsh shadows) or low-resolution webcam shots. These can cause face detectors to fail or embeddings to be less reliable. Implementing an **image preprocessing pipeline for dark/low-quality images** can substantially improve performance:

* **Illumination Enhancement:** Brightening a dark face image is often the first step. Simple techniques like **adaptive gamma correction and histogram equalization** (e.g. CLAHE – Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) can globally enhance brightness and contrast. For instance, combining gamma correction with CLAHE can make facial features more distinguishable in low light. These methods are fast and can be applied on the fly to each incoming frame. They aim to amplify details in underexposed regions of the face without blowing out well-lit parts.

* **Denoising and Deblurring:** Low-light images often suffer from high noise (from camera sensor ISO) and sometimes motion blur. Applying a denoising filter (median or bilateral filter for noise, or more advanced AI denoisers) can clean up the image before it goes into the face recognizer. If blur is detected, a deblurring algorithm or simply asking the user for another, sharper photo might be necessary – motion blur is hard to fully compensate via software.

* **Retinex-Based Enhancement:** Retinex algorithms mimic the human visual adaptation to lighting by separating illumination from reflectance. Methods like *Single-Scale Retinex* or *Multi-Scale Retinex with color restoration* can significantly improve visibility in shadows. There are also learned versions like **RetinexNet** which use deep learning to brighten images. These tend to preserve natural color while lighting dark regions. An evaluation compared RetinexNet, basic Retinex, gamma correction, and a learning-based method called MIRNet for low-light enhancement.

* **Deep Learning Enhancement:** Modern deep CNNs specifically trained for low-light image enhancement can yield impressive results. One example is **MIRNet** (a multi-resolution convolutional network) which has been shown to significantly improve face recognition in dark conditions. In one study, a pipeline combining MIRNet for image enhancement with ArcFace for recognition achieved much higher accuracy on very dim images than using ArcFace alone. In fact, at extremely low illumination (only 5% of normal light), applying MIRNet before ArcFace boosted Rank-1 accuracy to 84%, whereas ArcFace without enhancement struggled much more. This demonstrates the value of dedicated enhancement. Other deep enhancers like Zero-DCE (zero-reference curve estimation) or EnlightenGAN could also be used to automatically adjust brightness and contrast in a learned manner.

* **Face-Detection Aided Exposure:** Another approach is to use the face detection step to estimate lighting and then compensate. For example, if a face detector finds the face but with low confidence due to darkness, the system can programmatically increase camera exposure (if capturing live video) or apply a stronger enhancement filter to the detected face region only. Focusing on the face region for enhancement (instead of the whole image) can avoid amplifying irrelevant background noise.

* **Augmenting Training for Low-Light:** In addition to on-the-fly preprocessing, it’s wise to make the recognition model itself more robust to low-light by training-time augmentation. This means synthetically darkening some training face images or adding noise, so the network learns features that are invariant to illumination changes. Such training augmentation, combined with runtime enhancement, yields a dual approach to handle poor lighting.

Overall, a **cascade of pre-processing** can be implemented: first apply a mild brightness/contrast boost (gamma/CLAHE) to the image, then run face detection. If detection is successful and the face appears dark, optionally crop the face region and apply a stronger enhancement (like a lightweight Retinex or a small CNN) before feeding it to the recognition model. This ensures that key facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) are visible and clear despite low ambient light. By integrating these image enhancement techniques, the system becomes far more reliable for users taking photos at night or with bad cameras, avoiding false negatives due to lighting.

## Real-Time Deployment Considerations

For an online verification service, **real-time performance** is crucial – users expect quick results. Achieving low latency while maintaining accuracy involves choosing appropriate hardware and optimizing the model inference pipeline:

* **Hardware Options (GPU vs Edge Devices):** If the verification will be done on a server (cloud or on-premise), a powerful **GPU** is recommended to handle the face embedding model. Modern NVIDIA GPUs (such as the RTX/A100 series or even a Tesla T4 for cloud) can compute hundreds of face embeddings per second. This easily supports real-time processing (<0.1s per comparison) even with heavy models. On the other hand, if on-device or edge deployment is needed (say a dedicated kiosk or mobile unit in Cambodia), there are specialized devices like **NVIDIA Jetson**. For example, the Jetson Nano (a low-cost edge GPU) can run ArcFace at \~65 FPS using TensorRT optimizations. More powerful Jetson models (Xavier NX, Orin) or Google's Coral TPU can also accelerate face recognition on the edge. Edge deployment avoids network latency and can be useful for offline scenarios (e.g., border checkpoints or kiosks performing ID face match locally).

* **Model Optimization (TensorRT, ONNX, OpenVINO):** Converting the trained model to an optimized inference format greatly speeds it up. **NVIDIA TensorRT** is a high-performance inference engine that can take a model (in ONNX format, for instance) and compile it to an optimized runtime with FP16 or INT8 precision on Nvidia GPUs. By using TensorRT, one can often get 2-4× speed improvements and reduce latency to a few milliseconds per image. For CPU deployments, Intel’s **OpenVINO** toolkit can similarly optimize and accelerate inference (taking advantage of vector instructions and even GPU/FPGA if available). The model should be exported to ONNX or IR format, then run through these optimizers. In practice, an ArcFace ResNet100 model that might take \~50 ms on a CPU can potentially be brought down closer to real-time (e.g. 10-20 ms) with OpenVINO INT8 optimizations, albeit with careful calibration. For mobile, frameworks like **TensorFlow Lite** or **Core ML** allow running a smaller face recognition model on device neural accelerators.

* **Batching and Pipeline:** In a server scenario with many verifications, one can batch process face embeddings to fully utilize the GPU. However, for 1:1 verification, usually each request is small (one face from selfie, one from ID). The system can still run the two images through the network in parallel if using a GPU. The face detector can also be a bottleneck; using a fast detector (like RetinaFace or an SSD-based face detector) and resizing images appropriately can keep the pipeline speedy. If needed, the detection and recognition steps can be parallelized (e.g., use separate threads or even separate models for detection and recognition running concurrently).

* **Scalability and Throughput:** For high throughput (e.g., a verification service handling many users per minute), containerizing the model and scaling horizontally is an option. Using a solution like **NVIDIA Triton Inference Server** can simplify deploying the face recognition model with TensorRT across multiple GPUs and provide an HTTP/GRPC interface. Alternatively, a lightweight REST API using frameworks like FastAPI together with an optimized model (as seen in InsightFace-REST which uses TensorRT) can handle multiple requests asynchronously. The key is to ensure the model forward pass is the main cost (\~few tens of milliseconds) and avoid overhead in pre/post-processing with efficient code (use vectorized libraries, etc.).

* **Edge vs Cloud Trade-off:** If the verification must happen on a user’s device (for privacy or offline reasons), then a smaller model may be chosen, like a MobileFaceNet or a reduced ArcFace model, and run via ONNX Runtime or Core ML. But if privacy and latency can be managed, a cloud service with a heavyweight model (ArcFace ResNet100 or ViT) will yield the highest accuracy. Given this is for ID verification (often a controlled scenario), a typical architecture is to perform face matching on the server side to avoid exposing the reference passport photo publicly.

In summary, **for real-time performance** use hardware acceleration (GPU or NPU), optimize the model (TensorRT/ONNX), and streamline the pipeline. A recommended stack for server deployment is: an **NVIDIA GPU with TensorRT** – e.g., deploy the ArcFace/ViT model as a TensorRT engine. This has been shown to run face recognition extremely fast (ArcFace at tens of FPS even on small Jetson devices). For edge deployments, choose a device like Jetson or use mobile inference libraries if GPU is not available. With these measures, the system will be able to handle live face verification without noticeable delay to the user.

## Techniques for Age-Invariant Matching (10-Year Gap)

A core objective is to maximize matching accuracy when the probe and reference images differ by up to a decade in age. Human faces undergo changes (hair graying, wrinkles, minor shape changes) over 10 years, and traditional face recognition can see reduced similarity scores for the same person with age differences. Here we discuss techniques to specifically enhance **age invariance** in the face recognition system:

* **Age-Invariant Feature Learning:** The idea is to encourage the network’s embedding to encode identity in a way that is minimally affected by age. One approach is **multi-task learning** to explicitly separate age-related and identity-related features. For instance, a model can be designed with two branches: one that predicts identity and one that predicts age (or an age group), and an adversarial or orthogonal constraint between them. Huang *et al.* (2021) propose a framework (MTL-Face) where an attention mechanism **decomposes face features into identity and age components, then uses multi-task training to decorrelate them**. The model learns to factor out aging information, producing an identity embedding that remains stable as the person ages. In practical terms, implementing this might involve adding an auxiliary age-estimation loss during training and forcing the gradient from that loss not to degrade identity discrimination. By the end, the network cannot easily tell a person’s age from the embedding (age-invariant), yet can still distinguish who it is.

* **Adversarial Age Regularization:** Similar to the above, one can use an adversarial loss where a secondary network tries to predict the age of the person from the face embedding, and the recognizer is penalized if the age can be predicted. This pushes the embeddings to drop age-specific cues. The result is an embedding space where young and old faces of the same person cluster tightly. This technique has been part of several research works under Age-Invariant Face Recognition (AIFR) approaches.

* **Face Age Synthesis (Normalization):** Another technique is to *normalize the age difference* by preprocessing or augmenting the images themselves. Using generative models (GANs or morphable models), one can **transform a face to a target age**. For example, given a current 25-year-old face and a 10-year-old ID photo, synthesize the 25-year-old face as it might have looked at 15, or vice versa, to compare two faces of similar apparent age. This is the Face Age Synthesis (FAS) approach. Modern GAN-based age progression/regression can produce fairly realistic aged faces. One could generate an aged version of the current selfie to match the ID photo’s age. However, caution is needed: synthesis can introduce artifacts that might confuse the recognizer if not done perfectly. A unified approach is sometimes best – for instance, MTL-Face mentioned above actually combined AIFR and FAS: it **learns age-invariant embeddings while simultaneously outputting photo-realistic faces at different ages for interpretability**. For deployment, pure synthesis for each verification might be too slow and complex, but it could be used offline to augment training data (as mentioned, synthetic aging augmentation).

* **Marginal Loss Adjustments for Age:** The typical ArcFace/CosFace loss enforces a fixed margin for all comparisons. Some recent ideas adjust the loss dynamically based on sample difficulty or quality. While not explicitly for age, they can indirectly help with age gaps. For example, **AdaFace** introduces a quality-adaptive margin – if an image is of lower quality (blurry, or potentially very aged?), the loss margin is reduced so the model doesn’t over-penalize intra-class variations. In our context, an older ID photo might be lower quality (scanned or faded) and also has natural age difference; a model like AdaFace would treat comparisons involving that photo as “harder” and allow a slightly larger tolerance in embedding distance for a match. This kind of adaptive learning could be beneficial in maintaining matches across age gaps. Similarly, **CurricularFace** is a loss that schedules easy vs hard sample emphasis during training – faces with large age difference could be considered hard pairs, and the curriculum loss would gradually force the model to handle them.

* **Direct Fine-Tune on Aged Pairs:** A practical engineering solution is to fine-tune or calibrate the model on a dataset of positive pairs with large age differences. For example, collect pairs of photos of the same people \~10 years apart (if available, e.g. from public celebrity images or family albums) and ensure the model outputs high similarity for them. This can be done by mining a subset of the training data or external data for people with multiple ages. One could then perform a few epochs of training where those cross-age pairs are given a higher weight (or use a contrastive loss on those pairs to explicitly pull them together in embedding space). This kind of targeted fine-tuning can directly improve the 1:1 verification true accept rate for long time lapses.

* **Score Normalization by Age Estimate:** In the verification stage, if an estimate of age can be made from each image, the system could adjust the matching threshold based on the age gap. For instance, if a face appears much older/younger than the ID photo, require a slightly higher similarity score to accept (since age can add uncertainty). Conversely, if they look close in age (the ID photo is recent), use the standard threshold. This is a heuristic but could account for the increased difficulty of matching across age. An alternative is to use the age estimate to assist matching, e.g. by guiding a face synthesis as mentioned.

Each of these techniques can be combined. For example, the final system could use an ArcFace model that was *trained with age-invariant losses and augmented aged data*, and at runtime, it might apply a slight threshold adjustment for large predicted age gaps. The overarching goal is to ensure that as a person ages, their embedding in the feature space moves only minimally. Empirically, modern deep models like ArcFace are already quite good – studies found ArcFace’s accuracy drops only modestly for age gaps compared to earlier algorithms. By applying the above strategies, we can further narrow the gap. In the end, the system should be able to verify a person’s face against a 10-year-old ID photo with high confidence, as long as the face is clear, by focusing on invariant features (bone structure, ratios, key facial landmarks) rather than transient features (hairstyle, minor wrinkles).

## Conclusion

Building a face recognition system for online ID verification that works reliably over a 10-year age span and in challenging image conditions is feasible with today’s advanced models and techniques. **Model selection** should start with the best-in-class face recognizers – ArcFace and CosFace offer excellent accuracy (≈99.8% on benchmark tests) and proven robustness, while emerging transformer-based models promise further improvements in both accuracy and speed. It’s crucial to **adapt these models to the local context**: fine-tune on Cambodian and regional faces to mitigate any demographic biases, and include age variation in training (through real or synthetic data) so the embeddings remain consistent as faces age. The system must also be engineered to handle **low-quality inputs** – integrating image enhancement methods like adaptive brightness/contrast adjustments, denoising, or even learning-based low-light enhancement can dramatically improve recognition in dark conditions. For **deployment**, leveraging hardware acceleration and optimization frameworks ensures real-time response; e.g., using an NVIDIA GPU with TensorRT can yield inference in mere milliseconds, and even edge devices can run the models at acceptable frame rates. Finally, incorporating **age-invariance techniques** at the algorithmic level (multi-task learning to separate age and identity, age-agnostic training losses, or even face age normalization) will directly address the 10-year gap challenge, ensuring that the same person’s face embeds closely whether they are 20 or 30 years old.

By combining these approaches – powerful pre-trained models, domain-specific fine-tuning, robust preprocessing, optimized deployment, and age-invariant tuning – the resulting face recognition system will be well-equipped for online ID verification in Cambodia. It will be capable of quickly and accurately verifying a selfie against a decade-old passport photo, even if the images are dark or the person has aged noticeably, thereby meeting the key objectives of reliability, speed, and accuracy in this demanding scenario.
